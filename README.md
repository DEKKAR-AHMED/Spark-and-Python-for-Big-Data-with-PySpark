Udemy Cercitification - Training + Project
###### - Manipulate and word abd DataBricks (Setup + Creating Cluster, ....)
###### - AWS EC2 ( Training + setUp )
###### AWS EMR ( Cluster Set UP + Training )
###### - Training on Spark DataFrame (Operation, GroupBy, AGG, Missing Value , normalization, Transform Categorical features, Dates and Timestamps) 
###### - Machine Learning with Pyspark (MLib , sql ) libraries and cover most Supervised learningfor regression and classification 
(Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Linear Regression ,... ) and Unsupervised Learning ( Kmeans ). training + Simple project.
###### -Training on the recommendation system basic by using ALS algorithm but we can go further using SVD , SVD ++ to solve like Netflix Recommendation Prize.
###### -Natural Language Processing  (Training + Spam Detector as project ) using PySpark and Mlib and the different NLP tool for the processing in Spark.
###### -Spark Streaming with Python. (training through a simple Stream examppe, then finishsh the chapter with Twitter Analysis Project  using tweepy (Visualization libraires)) doing such like scraping data in twitter
